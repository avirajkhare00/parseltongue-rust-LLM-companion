FIXTURE: T152-cpp-field-access-pointer-edges
LANGUAGE: C++
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Field access via -> and . creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - pointer.cpp    (pointer field access user->name)
  - reference.cpp  (reference field access user.name)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  pointer.cpp:
    - fn "process"
  reference.cpp:
    - fn "update"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  pointer.cpp:
    - process -> name  (field access via ->)
    - process -> age   (field access via ->)
  reference.cpp:
    - update -> name   (field access via .)
    - update -> age    (field access via .)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  pointer.cpp: at least 2 edges (name, age)
  reference.cpp: at least 2 edges (name, age)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None
