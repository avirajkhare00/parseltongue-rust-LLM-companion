FIXTURE: T268-cross-algorithm-integration-test
LANGUAGE: N/A (pure algorithm integration, no source code parsing)
CATEGORY: Graph Analysis - Cross-Algorithm Consistency
VALIDATES: All 7 graph analysis algorithms work together correctly and produce correlated results

REFERENCE GRAPHS:
  1. 8-node graph: A→B, A→C, B→D, C→D, D→E→F→D, G→H→G
  2. 5-node chain: A→B→C→D→E
  3. 1000-node performance graph: hub-and-spoke + chain

TEST FUNCTIONS (9):
  BASIC INTEGRATION TESTS:
  - test_all_seven_algorithms_run_on_eight_node_graph: Validates all 7 algorithms succeed

    * PageRank: 8 values, sum ≈ 1.0
    * Betweenness: 8 values
    * Entropy: 8 values
    * CK Metrics: 8 CBO values
    * Leiden: ≥1 community
    * SQALE: 8 debt results

  - test_all_seven_algorithms_run_on_chain_graph: Validates all 7 on linear chain
    * Tarjan: 5 singleton SCCs
    * K-Core: all coreness ≤ 1
    * PageRank: E (sink) highest
    * Betweenness: middle nodes highest
    * Entropy: all ≈ 0 (single edge type)
    * CK Metrics: all CBO ≤ 2
    * Leiden: 5 communities
    * SQALE: all debt ≤ 100.0

  CROSS-ALGORITHM CONSISTENCY TESTS:
  - test_scc_nodes_share_kcore_level: Validates D-E-F (SCC) share k-core=2
  - test_high_betweenness_implies_high_pagerank: Validates D (bridge) in top 3 PageRank
  - test_cycle_nodes_detected_by_both_scc_and_leiden: Validates D-E-F in same SCC + same Leiden community
  - test_isolated_pair_consistent_across_algorithms: Validates G-H consistency:
    * Same SCC (2-node cycle)
    * Same Leiden community
    * Same k-core value
    * Similar PageRank (symmetric cycle)
  - test_sqale_debt_correlates_with_coupling: Validates higher CBO → higher debt

  PERFORMANCE TEST:
  - test_performance_large_graph_completes: Validates 1000-node graph completes without panic

  EDGE CASE TEST:
  - test_empty_graph_all_algorithms_return_empty: Validates graceful empty graph handling

CONSISTENCY PROPERTIES VALIDATED:
  1. SCC membership → same k-core level (structural correlation)
  2. High betweenness → high PageRank (importance correlation)
  3. Cycle detection: SCC + Leiden agree (algorithmic consistency)
  4. Isolated components: consistent across all metrics (modularity consistency)
  5. Coupling → debt: higher CBO → higher SQALE debt (metric correlation)
  6. Empty graph: all algorithms return empty/zero (robustness)
  7. Large graph: all algorithms complete (scalability)

CORRELATION SEMANTICS:
  - SCC + K-Core: Cycle nodes have higher coreness (dense subgraphs)
  - Betweenness + PageRank: Bridge nodes are important (centrality correlation)
  - SCC + Leiden: Cycles form communities (modularity alignment)
  - CBO + SQALE: High coupling = high debt (maintainability correlation)
  - Entropy + CK: Mixed edge types = low cohesion (complexity correlation)

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
  - 8-node graph: <10ms total (all 7 algorithms)
  - 1000-node graph: <1s total (with reduced PageRank iterations=50)
  - Empty graph: <1ms total (graceful early exit)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  - Leiden is randomized (community IDs may vary across runs)
  - PageRank convergence may vary (tolerance-dependent)
  - K-Core monotonicity can inflate peripheral node coreness
  - Large graphs (>10K nodes) may timeout Betweenness (O(VE))
