FIXTURE: T042-python-attribute-access-edges
LANGUAGE: Python
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Property access creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - attribute_access.py          (basic attribute access)
  - property_getter_setter.py    (property getters and setters)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  attribute_access.py:
    - function "process"

  property_getter_setter.py:
    - class "DataModel" with method "update"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  attribute_access.py:
    - process -> name              (attribute read)
    - process -> age               (attribute write)
    - process -> parent            (nested access)
    - process -> child             (nested access)

  property_getter_setter.py:
    - update -> setting            (property getter)
    - update -> config             (property setter)
    - update -> data               (nested property)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  attribute_access.py: at least 2 edges (name, age)
  property_getter_setter.py: at least 2 edges (setting, config)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None.
