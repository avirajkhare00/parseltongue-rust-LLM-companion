FIXTURE: T262-entropy-complexity-measurement
LANGUAGE: N/A (pure algorithm, no source code parsing)
CATEGORY: Graph Analysis - Complexity Measurement
VALIDATES: Shannon entropy algorithm correctly measures edge type diversity

SOURCE FILES:
  None. This is a documentation-only T-folder for a pure-logic algorithm.
  Tests are inline in: crates/parseltongue-core/src/graph_analysis/entropy_complexity_algorithm.rs

ALGORITHM CONTRACT:
  - Input: AdjacencyListGraphRepresentation + node name
  - Output: Entropy score H (0 to log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 for 3 edge types)
  - Formula: H(X) = -Σ p(x) log₂ p(x) (Shannon 1948)
  - Semantic meaning: Diversity of edge types (Calls, Uses, Implements)
    * H = 0: All edges same type (focused responsibility)
    * H ≈ 1.585: Uniform distribution across 3 types (mixed responsibility)

EDGE TYPES:
  - Calls (function invocations)
  - Uses (data dependencies)
  - Implements (interface/trait implementations)

ENTROPY SCENARIOS:
  1. Single edge type: H = 0.0 (perfect focus)
  2. Two types (3 Calls, 1 Uses): H ≈ 0.811 (moderate diversity)
  3. Uniform 3 types (2 Calls, 2 Uses, 2 Implements): H ≈ 1.585 (high diversity)
  4. No edges: H = 0.0 (trivial case)

COMPLEXITY CLASSIFICATION:
  - classify_entropy_complexity_level(H):
    * H < 1.0 → EntropyComplexity::Low
    * 1.0 ≤ H < 1.4 → EntropyComplexity::Moderate
    * H ≥ 1.4 → EntropyComplexity::High
  - Semantic meaning:
    * Low: Focused responsibility (good separation of concerns)
    * Moderate: Mixed responsibility (needs review)
    * High: Scattered responsibility (refactoring candidate)

TEST FUNCTIONS (8):
  - test_entropy_uniform_three_types: Validates H ≈ 1.585 for uniform distribution (2 of each type)
  - test_entropy_single_type_zero: Validates H = 0.0 for all Calls edges
  - test_entropy_no_edges_zero: Validates H = 0.0 for node with no outgoing edges
  - test_entropy_nonexistent_node: Validates H = 0.0 for nonexistent node (graceful fallback)
  - test_classify_entropy_levels: Validates classification thresholds (Low/Moderate/High)
  - test_entropy_two_types_mixed: Validates H ≈ 0.811 for 3 Calls + 1 Uses (asymmetric distribution)
  - test_compute_all_entropy_scores: Validates batch computation for all nodes
  - test_entropy_two_types_mixed: Validates correct probability calculation (p=0.75, p=0.25)

ALGORITHM DETAILS:
  - Only considers outgoing edges (forward neighbors)
  - Uses forward edge type lookup via graph.lookup_edge_type_between()
  - Graceful handling: nonexistent nodes or no edges → H = 0.0
  - Batch computation: compute_all_entity_entropy() for whole graph

MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES:
  - H_max = log₂(k) where k = number of edge types (3 for Parseltongue)
  - H_max ≈ 1.585 for 3 types
  - H = 0 when all edges are same type (deterministic)
  - H increases with edge type uniformity

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  - Only considers outgoing edges (ignores incoming edge diversity)
  - Fixed to 3 edge types (Calls, Uses, Implements)
  - Does not account for edge weight or frequency beyond counts
  - Classification thresholds are heuristic (not derived from empirical data)
