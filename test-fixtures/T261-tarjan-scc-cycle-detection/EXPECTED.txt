FIXTURE: T261-tarjan-scc-cycle-detection
LANGUAGE: N/A (pure algorithm, no source code parsing)
CATEGORY: Graph Analysis - Cycle Detection
VALIDATES: Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components algorithm correctly identifies cycles and risk levels

SOURCE FILES:
  None. This is a documentation-only T-folder for a pure-logic algorithm.
  Tests are inline in: crates/parseltongue-core/src/graph_analysis/tarjan_scc_algorithm.rs

REFERENCE GRAPH:
  8-node fixture graph with known cycle structure (defined in test_fixture_reference_graphs.rs)
  Structure:
    A → B, A → C (tree root)
    B → D, C → D (converge to D)
    D → E → F → D (3-node cycle)
    G → H → G (2-node cycle, isolated)

  Expected SCCs (5 components):
    - {D, E, F} (3-node cycle, HIGH risk)
    - {G, H} (2-node cycle, MEDIUM risk)
    - {A} (singleton, NONE risk)
    - {B} (singleton, NONE risk)
    - {C} (singleton, NONE risk)

ALGORITHM CONTRACT:
  - Input: AdjacencyListGraphRepresentation (directed graph)
  - Output: Vec<Vec<String>> of SCCs, sorted by size descending
  - Complexity: O(V + E) single DFS pass (Tarjan 1972)
  - Risk classification:
    * NONE: size 1 (no cycle)
    * MEDIUM: size 2 (2-node cycle)
    * HIGH: size 3+ (multi-node cycle)

TEST FUNCTIONS (7):
  - test_tarjan_scc_count_exact: Validates exactly 5 SCCs found on 8-node graph
  - test_tarjan_scc_three_node_cycle: Validates D-E-F form a 3-member SCC (sorted members)
  - test_tarjan_scc_two_node_cycle: Validates G-H form a 2-member SCC (sorted members)
  - test_tarjan_scc_singleton_nodes: Validates A, B, C are singleton SCCs (3 total)
  - test_classify_scc_risk_level: Validates risk level classification (None/Medium/High)
  - test_tarjan_empty_graph: Validates empty graph returns 0 SCCs
  - test_tarjan_chain_all_singletons: Validates linear chain (5 nodes) produces 5 singleton SCCs

ALGORITHM DETAILS:
  - Uses Tarjan's 1972 algorithm with DFS + lowlink values
  - Maintains stack and on_stack set for efficient SCC extraction
  - SCCs sorted by size descending for consistent output
  - Handles disconnected components correctly

RISK LEVEL CLASSIFICATION:
  - classify_scc_risk_level(size):
    * size 0 or 1 → SccRiskLevel::None
    * size 2 → SccRiskLevel::Medium
    * size 3+ → SccRiskLevel::High
  - Semantic meaning:
    * NONE: No cycle (safe)
    * MEDIUM: Simple cycle (moderate refactoring risk)
    * HIGH: Complex cycle (high maintenance burden)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  - Does not report cycle paths (only membership)
  - Does not distinguish inner vs outer cycles in nested structures
  - SCCs sorted by size, not by topological order
