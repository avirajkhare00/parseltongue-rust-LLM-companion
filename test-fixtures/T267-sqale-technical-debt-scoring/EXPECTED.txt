FIXTURE: T267-sqale-technical-debt-scoring
LANGUAGE: N/A (pure algorithm, no source code parsing)
CATEGORY: Graph Analysis - Technical Debt
VALIDATES: SQALE technical debt scoring based on ISO 25010 metrics violations

SOURCE FILES:
  None. This is a documentation-only T-folder for a pure-logic algorithm.
  Tests are inline in: crates/parseltongue-core/src/graph_analysis/sqale_debt_scoring_algorithm.rs

REFERENCE GRAPH:
  8-node fixture graph (test_fixture_reference_graphs.rs)
  Node D: High coupling candidate (in-degree=3, out-degree=1)

SQALE DEBT MODEL (ISO 25010):
  - Technical debt = sum of remediation hours for violated metrics
  - Based on CK metrics: CBO, LCOM, WMC (proxy for cyclomatic complexity)
  - DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) SKIPPED: no "Inherits" edge type

VIOLATION THRESHOLDS:
  1. CBO > 10 → HighCoupling → 4.0 hours remediation
  2. LCOM > 0.8 → LowCohesion → 8.0 hours remediation
  3. WMC > 15 → HighComplexity → 2.0 hours remediation

DEBT SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:
  - classify_debt_severity_level(total_hours):
    * 0.0 → DebtSeverity::None (no violations)
    * 0.0 < debt ≤ 4.0 → DebtSeverity::Low
    * 4.0 < debt ≤ 8.0 → DebtSeverity::Medium
    * debt > 8.0 → DebtSeverity::High

VIOLATION TYPES:
  - SqaleViolationType::HighCoupling (CBO > 10)
  - SqaleViolationType::LowCohesion (LCOM > 0.8)
  - SqaleViolationType::HighComplexity (WMC > 15)

TEST FUNCTIONS (9):
  - test_sqale_no_violations_low_coupling: Validates node G has 0.0 debt (low coupling)
  - test_sqale_node_d_highest_debt: Validates node D is assessed (cycle node)
  - test_sqale_violation_types_correct: Validates HighCoupling violation for CBO=11
  - test_sqale_high_complexity_violation: Validates HighComplexity violation for WMC=16
  - test_sqale_empty_graph: Validates empty graph returns empty results
  - test_sqale_debt_severity_classification: Validates severity thresholds
  - test_sqale_all_entities_sorted_by_debt: Validates results sorted descending by debt
  - test_sqale_multiple_violations_sum: Validates 3 violations (CBO + LCOM + WMC) sum to 14.0 hours
  - test_sqale_debt_correlates_with_coupling: (Implicit in integration tests)

ALGORITHM DETAILS:
  - calculate_technical_debt_sqale(node, graph):
    * Check CBO via calculate_coupling_between_objects()
    * Check LCOM via calculate_lack_cohesion_methods()
    * Check WMC via calculate_weighted_methods_class()
    * Sum remediation hours for all violations

  - compute_all_entities_sqale(graph):
    * Calculate debt for all nodes
    * Sort by total_debt_hours descending (highest debt first)

MULTI-VIOLATION EXAMPLE:
  - Node with 16 outgoing disconnected edges:
    * CBO = 16 > 10 → +4.0 hours
    * LCOM = 1.0 > 0.8 → +8.0 hours (no shared targets)
    * WMC = 16 > 15 → +2.0 hours
    * Total debt = 14.0 hours (High severity)

DEBT INTERPRETATION:
  - 0 hours: Clean code (no violations)
  - 4 hours: One coupling violation (1 sprint story point)
  - 8 hours: One cohesion violation (1 day refactoring)
  - 14+ hours: Multiple violations (high priority refactoring)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  - Remediation hours are ISO 25010 estimates (not calibrated to codebase)
  - WMC uses out-degree as proxy (not true cyclomatic complexity)
  - LCOM uses graph structure (not field access patterns)
  - DIT skipped (no inheritance edges)
  - Does not account for business value or risk (only technical metrics)
