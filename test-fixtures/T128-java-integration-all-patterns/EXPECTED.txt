FIXTURE: T128-java-integration-all-patterns
LANGUAGE: Java
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Integration test combining constructors, streams, field access

SOURCE FILES:
  - service.java  (complete service with multiple patterns)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  service.java:
    - class "UserService"
    - method "UserService" (constructor)
    - method "getActiveUserNames"
    - method "createUser"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  service.java:
    - UserService -> UserRepository  (constructor call)
    - createUser -> User             (constructor call)
    - getActiveUserNames -> stream   (stream operation)
    - getActiveUserNames -> filter   (stream operation)
    - getActiveUserNames -> map      (stream operation)
    - getActiveUserNames -> collect  (stream operation)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  service.java: at least 5 edges (constructors + stream ops)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None
