FIXTURE: T022-rust-field-access-edges
LANGUAGE: Rust
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Field access expressions create dependency edges in non-call contexts

SOURCE FILES:
  - field_simple.rs       (simple field reads: user.name, user.age)
  - field_assignment.rs   (field writes: user.age = 30, user.name = ...)
  - field_nested.rs       (nested field access: config.settings.timeout)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  field_simple.rs:
    - fn "process" (function accessing User fields)

  field_assignment.rs:
    - fn "update" (function assigning to User fields)

  field_nested.rs:
    - fn "get_value" (function accessing nested Config fields)

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  The extractor should detect field access patterns in both read and write
  contexts. Each field access creates a dependency edge from the enclosing
  function to the accessed field identifier.

  field_simple.rs:
    - process -> name       (field read: user.name)
    - process -> age        (field read: user.age)

  field_assignment.rs:
    - update -> age         (field write: user.age = 30)
    - update -> name        (field write: user.name = String::from("Alice"))

  field_nested.rs:
    - get_value -> settings     (first level: config.settings)
    - get_value -> timeout      (second level: settings.timeout)
    - get_value -> database     (first level: config.database)
    - get_value -> connection   (second level: database.connection)
    - get_value -> host         (third level: connection.host)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  field_simple.rs: at least 2 edges (name, age)
  field_assignment.rs: at least 2 edges (age, name)
  field_nested.rs: at least 3 edges (nested chain detection)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  Field access detection may vary based on tree-sitter query patterns.
  Some field accesses might be counted as method calls if followed by parentheses.
