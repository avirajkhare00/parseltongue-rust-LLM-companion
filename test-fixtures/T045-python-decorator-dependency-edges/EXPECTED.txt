FIXTURE: T045-python-decorator-dependency-edges
LANGUAGE: Python
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Decorators create dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - class_decorators.py       (decorators on class methods)
  - function_decorators.py    (decorators on functions)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  class_decorators.py:
    - class "MyClass" with methods "name", "create", "index"

  function_decorators.py:
    - function "process_order"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  class_decorators.py:
    - name -> property             (decorator)
    - create -> staticmethod       (decorator)
    - index -> route               (decorator)

  function_decorators.py:
    - process_order -> login_required    (decorator)
    - process_order -> validate_input    (decorator)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  class_decorators.py: at least 2 edges (property, staticmethod)
  function_decorators.py: at least 2 edges (login_required, validate_input)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None.

RELATED TESTS:
  None (decorators are Python-specific)
