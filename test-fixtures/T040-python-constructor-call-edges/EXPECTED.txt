FIXTURE: T040-python-constructor-call-edges
LANGUAGE: Python
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Class instantiation creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - class_call.py               (basic class() calls)
  - qualified_constructor.py    (qualified class calls like models.User())

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  class_call.py:
    - class "Service" with method "create"

  qualified_constructor.py:
    - class "Factory" with method "build"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  class_call.py:
    - create -> User               (class instantiation)
    - create -> Person             (class instantiation with args)
    - create -> Configuration      (class instantiation)

  qualified_constructor.py:
    - build -> User                (qualified constructor)
    - build -> Connection          (qualified constructor)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  class_call.py: at least 3 edges (User, Person, Configuration)
  qualified_constructor.py: at least 2 edges (User, Connection)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None.
