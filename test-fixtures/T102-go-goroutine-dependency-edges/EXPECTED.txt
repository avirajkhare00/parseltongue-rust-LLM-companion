FIXTURE: T102-go-goroutine-dependency-edges
LANGUAGE: Go
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Goroutine launches (go keyword) create dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - basic.go       (basic goroutine launches)
  - anonymous.go   (anonymous goroutine with closure)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  basic.go:
    - fn "main"
  anonymous.go:
    - fn "start"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  basic.go:
    - main -> processData     (goroutine launch)
    - main -> handleRequest   (goroutine launch)
  anonymous.go:
    - (anonymous) -> doWork   (call inside anonymous goroutine)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  basic.go: at least 2 edges (processData, handleRequest)
  anonymous.go: at least 1 edge (doWork)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None
