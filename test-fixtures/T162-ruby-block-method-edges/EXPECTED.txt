FIXTURE: T162-ruby-block-method-edges
LANGUAGE: Ruby
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Ruby block methods (.each, .map, .select) create dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - block_basic.rb    (each, map, select with {} blocks)
  - block_do_end.rb   (each, select with do...end blocks)
  - block_chained.rb  (select, map, compact, uniq, sort chained)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  - ruby:fn:process
  - ruby:fn:transform
  - ruby:fn:complex_transform

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES (REQ-RUBY-002.0):
  - process -> each
  - process -> map
  - process -> select
  - transform -> each
  - transform -> select
  - complex_transform -> select
  - complex_transform -> map
  - complex_transform -> compact
  - complex_transform -> uniq
  - complex_transform -> sort

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  - block_basic.rb: 3 edges (each, map, select)
  - block_do_end.rb: 2 edges (each, select)
  - block_chained.rb: 5 edges (select, map, compact, uniq, sort)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  - None
