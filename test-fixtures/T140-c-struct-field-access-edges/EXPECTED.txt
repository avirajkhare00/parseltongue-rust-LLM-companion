FIXTURE: T140-c-struct-field-access-edges
LANGUAGE: C
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Struct field access (-> and .) creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - arrow.c  (pointer field access user->name)
  - dot.c    (struct field access config.timeout)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  arrow.c:
    - fn "process"
  dot.c:
    - fn "setup"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  arrow.c:
    - process -> name  (field access via ->)
    - process -> age   (field access via ->)
  dot.c:
    - setup -> timeout (field access via .)
    - setup -> port    (field access via .)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  arrow.c: at least 2 edges (name, age)
  dot.c: at least 2 edges (timeout, port)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None
