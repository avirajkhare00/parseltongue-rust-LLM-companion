FIXTURE: T142-c-function-call-edges
LANGUAGE: C
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Function calls create dependency edges (regression test)

SOURCE FILES:
  - calls.c  (basic function calls)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  calls.c:
    - fn "main"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  calls.c:
    - main -> printf        (function call)
    - main -> process_data  (function call)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  calls.c: at least 2 edges (printf, process_data)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None

RELATED TESTS:
  - Regression test for existing function call detection
