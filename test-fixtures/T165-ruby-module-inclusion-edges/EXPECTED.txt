FIXTURE: T165-ruby-module-inclusion-edges
LANGUAGE: Ruby
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Ruby module inclusion (include, extend, prepend) creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - module_basic.rb       (basic include/extend/prepend statements)
  - module_qualified.rb   (qualified module inclusion: ActiveSupport::Callbacks)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  - ruby:module:Enumerable
  - ruby:module:Comparable
  - ruby:module:Serializable
  - ruby:class:MyCollection
  - ruby:module:ActiveSupport::Callbacks
  - ruby:module:ActiveSupport::Validations
  - ruby:module:Concerns::Cacheable
  - ruby:class:Model

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES (REQ-RUBY-003.0):
  From module_basic.rb:
  - MyCollection -> Enumerable (include statement)
  - MyCollection -> Comparable (extend statement)
  - MyCollection -> Serializable (prepend statement)

  From module_qualified.rb:
  - Model -> ActiveSupport::Callbacks (include qualified)
  - Model -> ActiveSupport::Validations (extend qualified)
  - Model -> Concerns::Cacheable (prepend qualified)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  - module_basic.rb: 3 edges (Enumerable, Comparable, Serializable)
  - module_qualified.rb: 3 edges (Callbacks, Validations, Cacheable)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  These tests are currently IGNORED (#[ignore]) because Ruby module inclusion
  detection is not yet implemented. The tree-sitter Ruby parser doesn't expose
  constant arguments for bareword method calls like `include Enumerable` in a
  queryable way. This is marked as P2 (low priority) and requires either
  tree-sitter grammar updates or custom parsing logic.

  T-folder serves as aspirational fixture for future implementation.

TREE-SITTER LIMITATION:
  The tree-sitter Ruby grammar currently represents `include Enumerable` as:
  - A method call node with method name "include"
  - A constant node "Enumerable" as an argument
  However, the constant argument is not captured in standard query patterns
  because it appears as a bare constant rather than in a queryable position.
