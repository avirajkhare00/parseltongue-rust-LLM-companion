FIXTURE: T086-typescript-collection-operation-edges
LANGUAGE: TypeScript
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Collection operations (map, filter, reduce) create dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - collection_map_filter.ts    (separate map and filter calls)
  - collection_chained.ts       (chained filter.map.reduce pipeline)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  collection_map_filter.ts:
    - class "Transformer" with method "transform"

  collection_chained.ts:
    - class "Pipeline" with method "process"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  collection_map_filter.ts:
    - transform -> map              (collection map operation)
    - transform -> filter           (collection filter operation)

  collection_chained.ts:
    - process -> filter             (chained filter)
    - process -> map                (chained map)
    - process -> reduce             (chained reduce)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  collection_map_filter.ts: map AND filter edges present
  collection_chained.ts: at least one of filter/map/reduce present

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None.
