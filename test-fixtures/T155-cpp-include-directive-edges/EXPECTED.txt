FIXTURE: T155-cpp-include-directive-edges
LANGUAGE: C++
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: #include directives create dependency edges (preprocessor-level)

SOURCE FILES:
  - includes.cpp  (system and local includes)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  includes.cpp:
    - fn "main"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  includes.cpp:
    - (module-level) -> iostream   (system include)
    - (module-level) -> custom     (local include)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  includes.cpp: at least 0 edges (see Known Limitations)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  CURRENT STATUS: Test is marked #[ignore] in cpp_dependency_patterns_test.rs

  C++ #include directives are preprocessor-level constructs. tree-sitter
  parses the post-preprocessor AST, meaning #include statements may not
  appear in the parse tree at all (they're replaced with the included content).

  Most tree-sitter C++ parsers do not expose preproc_include nodes as part
  of the standard AST. This is a fundamental limitation of parsing pre-processed
  code rather than source code.

  Future enhancement: Would require either:
  1. A custom preprocessing step to extract #include before parsing
  2. Using tree-sitter-cpp with preproc nodes enabled (if available)
  3. Static analysis of raw source text before tree-sitter parsing
