- **Individual design practice** to **product design at scale**
- **Usability** to **user experience** to **ethical design**
- **Western-centric design** to **global, diverse perspectives**

The voices highlighted in this document have shaped how millions of designers work, think, and approach problems. Their frameworks, books, talks, and methodologies have become foundational knowledge for the design community.

As we move into the next era, new voices will emerge, particularly around AI, climate design, and global challenges. But the foundations laid by these pioneers and modern practitioners will continue to influence design practice for decades to come.
