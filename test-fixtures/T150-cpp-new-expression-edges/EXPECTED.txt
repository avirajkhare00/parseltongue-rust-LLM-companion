FIXTURE: T150-cpp-new-expression-edges
LANGUAGE: C++
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: new_expression creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - simple.cpp    (basic new expressions)
  - template.cpp  (new with template types)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  simple.cpp:
    - fn "create"
  template.cpp:
    - fn "allocate"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  simple.cpp:
    - create -> User    (new expression)
    - create -> Config  (new expression)
  template.cpp:
    - allocate -> vector  (new expression with template)
    - allocate -> map     (new expression with template)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  simple.cpp: at least 2 edges (User, Config)
  template.cpp: at least 2 edges (vector, map)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None
