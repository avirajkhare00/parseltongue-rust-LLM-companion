FIXTURE: T103-go-field-access-edges
LANGUAGE: Go
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Field access (non-call context) creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - field_basic.go     (basic field access user.Name, user.Age)
  - field_nested.go    (nested field access sys.config.Settings.Timeout)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  field_basic.go:
    - fn "process"
  field_nested.go:
    - fn "read"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  field_basic.go:
    - process -> Name     (field access: user.Name read)
    - process -> Age      (field access: user.Age write)
  field_nested.go:
    - read -> config      (field access: sys.config)
    - read -> Settings    (field access: config.Settings)
    - read -> Timeout     (field access: Settings.Timeout)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  field_basic.go: at least 2 edges (Name, Age)
  field_nested.go: at least 3 edges (config, Settings, Timeout)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  CURRENT STATUS: Tests are marked #[ignore] in go_dependency_patterns_test.rs

  Go's tree-sitter grammar cannot distinguish field access from method calls
  without type information. Field access (user.Name) is a bare selector_expression,
  while method calls (user.Method()) are call_expression wrapping selector_expression.

  Capturing both would create duplicates for method calls. Future enhancement:
  add field_access pattern and mark duplicates with different EdgeType.
