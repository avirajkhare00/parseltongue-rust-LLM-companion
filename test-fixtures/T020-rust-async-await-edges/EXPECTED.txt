FIXTURE: T020-rust-async-await-edges
LANGUAGE: Rust
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Async/await expressions create dependency edges to awaited functions

SOURCE FILES:
  - async_basic.rs       (basic await on function call and method call)
  - async_error.rs       (await with ? error propagation operator)
  - async_chain.rs       (chained await expressions on method call results)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  async_basic.rs:
    - fn "load_data" (async function)

  async_error.rs:
    - fn "process" (async function returning Result)

  async_chain.rs:
    - fn "complex_operation" (async function)

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  The extractor should detect calls made through .await expressions.
  Each await point creates a dependency edge from the enclosing function
  to the awaited function/method.

  async_basic.rs:
    - load_data -> fetch_data        (await on function call)
    - load_data -> get               (await on method call: client.get())

  async_error.rs:
    - process -> fetch               (await? on method: client.fetch())
    - process -> save_data           (await? on function call)

  async_chain.rs:
    - complex_operation -> fetch_user  (first await in chain)
    - complex_operation -> process     (second await in chain)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  async_basic.rs: at least 2 edges
  async_error.rs: at least 2 edges
  async_chain.rs: at least 2 edges

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None for Rust async/await detection.
