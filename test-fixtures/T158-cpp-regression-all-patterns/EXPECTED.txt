FIXTURE: T158-cpp-regression-all-patterns
LANGUAGE: C++
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Existing function call patterns still work (regression test)

SOURCE FILES:
  - calls.cpp  (basic function calls)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  calls.cpp:
    - fn "process"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  calls.cpp:
    - process -> calculate  (function call)
    - process -> validate   (function call)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  calls.cpp: at least 2 edges (calculate, validate)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None
