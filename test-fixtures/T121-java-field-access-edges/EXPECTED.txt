FIXTURE: T121-java-field-access-edges
LANGUAGE: Java
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Field access via getter methods creates dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - field_simple.java  (getter method calls for field access)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  field_simple.java:
    - class "Reader"
    - method "read"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  field_simple.java:
    - read -> getSetting   (getter method call - field access pattern)
    - read -> getPort      (getter method call - field access pattern)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  field_simple.java: at least 2 edges (getSetting, getPort)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  Java typically uses getters/setters instead of direct field access.
  Field access nodes may not always be captured as separate dependencies
  distinct from method calls. The tree-sitter parser captures method
  invocations (getSetting(), getPort()) as method_invocation nodes.
