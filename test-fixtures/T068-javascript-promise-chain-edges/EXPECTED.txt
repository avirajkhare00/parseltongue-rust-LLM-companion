FIXTURE: T068-javascript-promise-chain-edges
LANGUAGE: JavaScript
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Promise chain operations create dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - promise_then_catch.js    (then and catch)
  - promise_finally.js       (then, catch, finally)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  promise_then_catch.js:
    - function "fetchUser"

  promise_finally.js:
    - function "request"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  promise_then_catch.js:
    - fetchUser -> fetch       (call)
    - fetchUser -> then        (promise method)
    - fetchUser -> catch       (promise method)

  promise_finally.js:
    - request -> then          (promise method)
    - request -> catch         (promise method)
    - request -> finally       (promise method)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  promise_then_catch.js: at least 3 edges (fetch, then, catch)
  promise_finally.js: at least 3 edges (then, catch, finally)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  None.
