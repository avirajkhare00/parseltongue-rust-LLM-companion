FIXTURE: T208-csharp-edge-key-stability
LANGUAGE: C#
CATEGORY: Edge Key Format (ISGL1 v2)
VALIDATES: Edge key stability and timestamp handling across multiple entities/parses

SOURCE FILES:
- different_timestamps.cs: Multiple methods calling each other (tests timestamp diversity)
- key_stability.cs: Simple method call (tests key stability across parses)

EXPECTED BEHAVIORS:
1. different_timestamps.cs:
   - DoWork -> Helper edge (from DoWork)
   - Process -> DoWork edge (from Process)
   - Each edge should have unique timestamp if from different methods
   - Timestamps should be part of from_key format

2. key_stability.cs:
   - DoWork -> Helper edge
   - Same code parsed twice should produce identical edge keys
   - Keys should be deterministic and reproducible

KEY FORMAT VALIDATION:
- All from_keys should use ISGL1 v2 format: lang:type:name:semantic_path:Ttimestamp
- No line range separators ('-') before timestamp
- Semantic path starts with '__'
- Last component starts with 'T' (timestamp)

REQUIREMENT: REQ-EDGE-004.0 (Edge Key Stability)
