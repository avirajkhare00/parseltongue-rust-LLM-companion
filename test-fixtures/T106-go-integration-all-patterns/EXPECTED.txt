FIXTURE: T106-go-integration-all-patterns
LANGUAGE: Go
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Integration test combining multiple Go dependency patterns

SOURCE FILES:
  - combined.go  (composite literal + goroutine + field access)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  combined.go:
    - struct "Server"
    - method "Start"

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  combined.go:
    - Start -> Config           (composite literal)
    - Start -> handleRequests   (goroutine launch)
    - Start -> Port             (field access)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  combined.go: at least 2 edges (Config, handleRequests)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  Field access edges may not be captured (see REQ-GO-002.0)
