FIXTURE: T050-python-integration-all-patterns
LANGUAGE: Python
CATEGORY: Integration Test
VALIDATES: Multiple Python dependency patterns working together

SOURCE FILES:
  - integration.py    (comprehensive test of all Python patterns)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:

    - process_users -> User        (type hint)
    - process_users -> name        (attribute access)
    - process_users -> save_user   (async call)
    - process_users -> Logger      (constructor call)
