FIXTURE: T024-rust-iterator-method-edges
LANGUAGE: Rust
CATEGORY: Dependency Edges
VALIDATES: Iterator and collection method calls create dependency edges

SOURCE FILES:
  - iter_basic.rs        (iter, filter, map, collect chain)
  - iter_into.rs         (into_iter, filter, sum chain)
  - iter_aggregation.rs  (multiple iter calls with max, min, count)
  - iter_find_any.rs     (iter with find, any, all methods)
  - iter_fold.rs         (iter with fold accumulator)

EXPECTED ENTITIES:
  iter_basic.rs:
    - fn "transform" (function using iterator transformation)

  iter_into.rs:
    - fn "process" (function consuming iterator)

  iter_aggregation.rs:
    - fn "analyze" (function using multiple aggregation methods)

  iter_find_any.rs:
    - fn "search" (function using search/predicate methods)

  iter_fold.rs:
    - fn "calculate" (function using fold accumulator)

EXPECTED DEPENDENCY EDGES:
  The extractor should detect method calls on iterators as dependency edges.
  Each method in the iterator chain creates a separate dependency.

  iter_basic.rs:
    - transform -> iter      (create iterator)
    - transform -> filter    (filter iterator)
    - transform -> map       (map iterator)
    - transform -> collect   (collect results)

  iter_into.rs:
    - process -> into_iter   (consuming iterator)
    - process -> filter      (filter values)
    - process -> sum         (aggregate sum)

  iter_aggregation.rs:
    - analyze -> iter        (first iter call)
    - analyze -> max         (max aggregation)
    - analyze -> iter        (second iter call)
    - analyze -> min         (min aggregation)
    - analyze -> iter        (third iter call)
    - analyze -> count       (count aggregation)

  iter_find_any.rs:
    - search -> find         (find element)
    - search -> any          (any predicate)
    - search -> all          (all predicate)

  iter_fold.rs:
    - calculate -> fold      (fold accumulator)

MINIMUM EDGE COUNTS:
  iter_basic.rs: at least 4 edges (iter, filter, map, collect)
  iter_into.rs: at least 3 edges (into_iter, filter, sum)
  iter_aggregation.rs: at least 6 edges (3x iter + max + min + count)
  iter_find_any.rs: at least 3 edges (find, any, all)
  iter_fold.rs: at least 1 edge (fold)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  Iterator method detection depends on tree-sitter capturing method calls
  in chained expressions. Some complex iterator chains may not be fully captured.
